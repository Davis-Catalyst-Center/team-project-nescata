A list of ROMs that work decently at the moment

Current criteria:
	- Can't rely on scroll (it's broken)
	- Uses mapper 0 (NROM) (it's the only implemented one)

Classic ones that could work (untested):
	- pacman
	- donkey kong
	- mario bros
	- burgertime
	- popeye
	- wrecking crew

To demonstrate missing functionality:
	- tetris
	- super mario bros
